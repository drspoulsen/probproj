    <title> Shiny Hunting in Pokemon </title>
    <p>In the Pokemon games, players are tasked with catching and training digital
    monsters called Pokemon. People of all ages love these games for many different
    reasons. Some like to battle, some like to trade, while others like to search
    out and catch rare Pokemon. Some of the rarest Pokemon are <em>shiny</em> Pokemon,
    which are Pokemon with an alternate color scheme as compared to the usual monster.</p>
