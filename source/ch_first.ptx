  <introduction>
    <p>There are a lot of ways to think about probability philosophically, but
    we will save that nuance until we have a good working relationship with
    probability. For now, we will approach probability through the idea of
    equally likely outcomes. In short, to calculate the probability of a specific thing
    occuring, we will calculate the number of ways that the specific thing can occur, and
    divide by the total number of possible things. With this idea in mind,
    counting becomes paramount. Therefore, before we can deal with probability,
    we have to deal with counting.</p>
