      		Suppose that you just moved to a new country and brought a limited
          wardrobe of three shirts and four pants. How many outfits (pairings of
          shirts and pants) can you form? To see the answer, lay out all the
          possible outfits in a grid (you might need to label your shirts and
          pants, feel free to be creative!)
      	</li>

    		<li>
    			If you had 100 shirts and 20 pants, how many outfits could you form?
          Would you want to list out all the possible outfits?
