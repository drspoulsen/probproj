        <introduction>
          <p>
            Let's look at the set <m>A = \{1, 2, 3\}</m>.
          </p>
        </introduction>

        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              How many permutations of set A can you create?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              There are 6 permutations. <m>\{1, 2, 3\}, \{1, 3, 2\}, \{2, 1, 3\}, \{2, 3, 1\}, \{3, 1, 2\}</m>, and <m>\{3, 2, 1\}</m>.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </task>

        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Without writing them all down, does there seem to be another way to figure out how many permutations there will be of a set?
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Another way to find the amount of permutations a set will contain is to calculate <m>n!</m> where <m>n</m> is the number of elements within that set.
            </p>
          </solution>
        </task>
