  <title>Combinations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>In the previous section, Permutations, order mattered.
      However, in Combinations, order does <em>not</em> matter.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        How many different ways can we combine 3 elements of the set <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m>?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>\{1,2,3\}, \{2,3,4\}, \{1,2,4\}, \{1,3,4\}</m>. There are 4 different ways to arrange them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since order does not matter, <m>\{1,2,3\} = \{3,2,1\}</m>. Keep this in mind as we introduce
        some formulas.

      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <statement>
    <p>
  In Example 1, we are choosing 3 elements from a set with 4 elements.
  If we are dealing with larger sets, listing out all possibilities
  would take too long. Instead, we can use the following defintion.
    </p>
      <definition>
        <p>
        We define <m>{n \choose r}</m> for <m>0 \leq r \leq n</m> by,
      </p>
		      <p>
		      <me>{n \choose r} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          where <m>n</m> is the number of things we can choose from, and <m>r</m> is the
          number of things we want to choose. We read this as “n choose r.”
        </p>
      </definition>
      <p>
        This is called the Binomial Coefficient. Why? We’ll find out later. First,
        let’s put this into practice on the next example.
      </p>
  </statement>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose you’re in a class full of 21 students and the teacher asks you to help her
        with a task. You need to find four other classmates to help. How many different
        groups can you form?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>{n \choose r} = {20 \choose 4} = \frac{20!}{16!4!} = 4845</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have 20 classmates (<m>n</m>), and we choose four (<m>r</m>) of them.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let's use what we've learned in Sections 1.1 and 1.2 to solve the next example.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Imagine the colors in a candy bag are equally distributed. There is red, blue, green, and orange.
        If there was a way to differentiate between candies of the same color, how many different combinations of
        two candies of each other can we have if there are 64 total candies?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>64/4=16</m> candies of each color.
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>{16 \choose 2}{16 \choose 2}{16 \choose 2}{16 \choose 2}=
        (\frac{16!}{14!2!})^4 =
        207360000</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <statement>
    <p>
    Here's a useful fact:
      <p>
        <m>{n \choose r} = {n-1 \choose r-1} + {n-1 \choose r}</m>
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's think about why this is the case. Suppose we want to choose <m>r</m>
      elements from a set. Thus, there are two possibilities.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Back to this Binomial Coefficient we mentioned earlier.
      It is an important piece of the Binomial Theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem> <title>Binomial Theorem</title>
      <p>
        <me>(x+y)^{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \choose k} x^{k}y^{n-k}</me>
      </p>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Think about this in expanding powers of sums.
