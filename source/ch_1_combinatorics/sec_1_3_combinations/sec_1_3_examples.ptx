  <title>Examples</title>

  <p>
    Here is another example, but without a solution
  </p>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose youâ€™re in a class full of 21 students and the teacher asks you to help her
        with a task. You need to find four other classmates to help. How many different
        groups can you form?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>{n \choose r} = {20 \choose 4} = (\frac{20!}{16!4!}) = 4845</m>. We have 20 classmates, <m>n</m>, and we choose four, <m>r</m>, of them.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>

  <p>
    Although the next things are not examples, they give examples of blocks that are not examples.  First a theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_first-examples-theorem">
    <title>Theorem Title</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        This is the statement of the theorem.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        And this is its proof.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>

  <corollary xml:id="cor_first-examples-corollary">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A corollary that doesn't need a proof.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </corollary>

  <p>
    Perhaps at the end of the section, you want to add a note to the reader about how what you have fits into the larger scope of mathematics.

      Comment to the reader here.
