  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose we want to form a student-athlete committee at the university.
        We want this committee to representative of all sports, therefore, we pick two
        persons from each sport. There are 6 eligible baseball players, 12 eligible soccer
        players, 5 eligible football players, and 7 eligible lacrosse players. How many different
        committees can be formed?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>{6 \choose 2}{12 \choose 2}{5 \choose 2}{7 \choose 2} = (15)(66)(10)(21) = 207900</m>
      </p>
    </solution>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Expand <m>(x+y)^n</m>, where <m>n = 3</m>. Then, try when <m>n =4</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>(x+y)^3 = {3 \choose 0}x^0y^3 + {3 \choose 1}x^1y^2 + {3 \choose 2}x^2y^1
        + {3 \choose 3}x^3y^0 = y^3 + 3xy^2 + 2x^2y^1 + x^3</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>(x+y)^4 = {4 \choose 0}x^0y^4 + {4 \choose 1}x^1y^3 + {4 \choose 2}x^2y^2
        + {4 \choose 3}x^3y^1 + {4 \choose 4}x^4y^0 = y^4 + 4xy^3 + 6x^2y^2 + 4x^3y + x^4</m>
      </p>

      What do you notice?

    <p>
      Refer back to the previous example. What would it be when <m>n=5</m>? <m>6</m>?
