        Let's look back at our first example with the socks and shoes.
        Suppose you were just gifted a whole new wardrobe. You now have 12 pairs of socks,
        6 pairs of shoes, 10 shirts, and 8 pairs of pants. How many different outfits can you wear?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>(12)(6)(10)(8)=5760</m>
      </p>
    </solution>

      <p>
        You just bought a new lock for your locker. It requires 4 characters.
        However, the first two are letters and the second two are digits.
        How many different password combinations are there? What if no repeats are allowed?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>(26)(26)(10)(10) = 67600</m> possible password combinations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>(26)(25)(10)(9) = 58500</m> possible password combinations.
      </p>
