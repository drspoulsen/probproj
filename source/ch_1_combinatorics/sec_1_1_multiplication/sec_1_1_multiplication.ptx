  <introduction>
    <p>Suppose you just bought three new pairs of socks and a pair of shoes.
      With the socks and shoes you already have, you have a total of four
      pairs of socks and three pairs of shoes. How many different combinations
      of socks and shoes can you create? </p>

      If there are <m> m </m> possibilities of choices of <m> A </m>, and <m> n </m> possibilities of choices of <m> B </m>, then there are <m> mn </m> possibilities of choices of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
  Your friend suggests you hang all your records up on your wall. You have 4
  rock, and 2 heavy metal, 3 pop, and 2 classical. Suppose you want to hang
  one of each genre. How many different choices do you have to put up on your
  wall?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      <m>(4)(2)(3)(2) = 48</m>
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>
<example>
  <statement>
    <p>
    Suppose you have been given the job to assign your soccer team of five
    players, jersey numbers. You have numbers 1-9. Since no two players can
    wear the same number, how many possible choices are there?
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      <m>(9)(8)(7)(6)(5) = 15120</m>
