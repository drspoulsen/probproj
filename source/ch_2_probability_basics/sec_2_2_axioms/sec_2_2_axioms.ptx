<title>Probability Axioms</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    Before we dive in, let’s explain what an axiom is.
  </p>
	<definition><title>Axiom</title>
		<p>
			an unprovable rule or first principle accepted as true because it is self-
      evident or particularly useful. “Nothing can both be and not be at the
      same time and in the same respect” is an example of an axiom.
		</p>
	</definition>
	<p>
    Now, let’s define a few terms.
  </p>
  <definition><title>Experiment</title>
		<p>
			A repeatable procedure with well-defined possible outcomes.
		</p>
  </definition>
  <definition><title>Sample Space</title>
		<p>
			The set of all possible outcomes. Denoted by <m>S</m>, or <m>\Omega</m>.
		</p>
  </definition>
  <definition><title>Event</title>
		<p>
			A subset of the sample space.
		</p>
  </definition>
  <definition><title>Probability Function</title>
		<p>
			A function giving the probability for each event
		</p>
  </definition>
  <example>
		<statement>
      <p>
				Roll a fair dice.
      </p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				Experiment: roll the dice, report the number it lands on.
			</p>
      <p>
				Sample Space: <m>S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}</m>
			</p>
      <p>
				Events: <m>\{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\},\{4\},\{5\},\{6\},\emptyset ,
        \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}</m>
			</p>
      <p>
				Probability Function: <m>P(\{1\})= \frac{1}{6}, P(\21\})= \frac{1}{6}, P(\{3\})= \frac{1}{6}, P(\{4\})= \frac{1}{6}, P(\{5\})= \frac{1}{6}, P(\{6\})= \frac{1}{6}, P(\emptyset)=0, P(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\})=1</m>
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
</introduction>
<subsection><title>Axioms of Probability</title>
	<lemma>
		<p>
      1.	For any event <m>E</m>, <me>0 \leq P(E) \leq 1</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      2.	<m>P(S)=1</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      3.	For any sequence of mutually disjoint (or mutually exclusive) events <me>\bigcap_{i=1}^{ \infty} E_i = \emptyset </me> Then, <me>P \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{infty} E_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(E_i)</me>
		</p>
	</lemma>
    <p>
      The third Axiom, in other words, says the probability of the infinite union of disjoint events <m>E_1,E_2, E_3,…</m> is equal to the total sum of the probability of each event.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Remember that an event is a subset of the sample space. Now, consider an arbitrary amount of events.
          What can we conclude about the comparison between sum of the probabilities of these events and the probability of the sample space?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <me>\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(E_i) \leq P(S) = 1</me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <example>
	   <statement>
		     <p>
			        Imagine you want to draw from a standard deck of cards. Consider two
              events, <m>A</m>, picking a red card and <m>B</m> picking a club.
              What is <m>P(A \cap B)</m>? <m>P(A \cup B)</m>?
		     </p>
       </statement>
	   <solution>
		      <p>
			         <m>P(A \cap B) = \emptyset </m> since they are mutually disjoint events.
		      </p>
		      <p>
            <m>P(A \cup B) = P(A)+P(B)=\frac{26}{52}+\frac{13}{52}=\frac{3}{4}</m>.
		      </p>
	   </solution>
    </example>

<subsection><title>Consequences of Axioms</title>
  <p>
    We call these consequences because these are additional rules or things we can prove true
    based on the axioms we defined.
  </p>
  <remark><title>Complement Rule</title>
    <p>
			Let <m>A</m> be an event. Then, <me>P(A^{c})=1-P(A)</me>
    </p>
  </remark>
  <remark><title>Monotonicity</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be events. If <m>A \subseteq B</m>
      then <me>P(A) \leq P(B)</me>
    </p>
  </remark>
  <remark><title>Union of Sets</title>
    <p>
	     <m>P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)-P(A \cap B)</m>
    </p>
