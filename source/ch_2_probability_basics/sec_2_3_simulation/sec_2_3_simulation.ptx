  <title>Simulation</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>So far, we have been able to calculate probabilities in two ways.
    The first is counting the size of an event, and dividing by the size of the
  sample space, under the assumption that each singleton event is equally likely.
The second is to argue from the axioms of theorems of probability. Sometimes, it
can be difficult, if not impossible, to calculate a probability using the
the aforementioned techniques. Also, for students and experts alike, mistakes
in calculating a probability can easily occur. Being able to arrive at an
approximation of a probability by running experiments is an essential tool for
analyzing probabilities. </p>
<p>
A simulation can be done without a computer. For example, if you want to know the
probability seeing at least one five when you roll four six-sided dice simultaneously,
you could roll four dice many times, and count the number of times you see a five
on at least one dice. An estimate for the probability will be the number of times
you see at least one five divided by the number of times you rolled the four dice.
If the mathematical model of probability matches our collective intuition of what
probability is, then we should expect that as the number of rolls of four dice
gets larger and larger, the estimated probability should approach the "true"
probability.
</p>
<p>
  That said, the idea of taking a day or two to just roll dice sounds a little tedious.
  Instead, we will have a computer roll the dice for us, so to speak. Let's just
  say getting computers to generate numbers that behave like random rolls of the
  dice has been studied and engineered, so we will just take advantage of that.

<p>
  For our work, we will use Sage, which is an open-source computer algebra system.
  In the online version of this book, you can execute and manipulate the code live.
