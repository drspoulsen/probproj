  <title>Independence</title>
    <p>
      Look at the formal definition of the word independence.
      Think about this definition and its meaning in mathematics.
    </p>
  <definition>
    <p>
      Not depending on something else for strength or effectiveness; freestanding
    </p>
  </definition>
  <p>
    How do you think this relates to probability?
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose you roll a fair six-sided dice and it’s a four. Will this affect your next roll? Are you more likely to get a four? Less likely?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
      The first roll should not affect the second roll. We should be equally like to get
      a four on the second roll as we did the first. This is because these are two independent
      events.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <definition>
    <p>
      Two events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent if <me>P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)</me>
    </p>
  </definition>
    <p>
      To relate back the example we had earlier, think of the first roll as ‘Event A’ and the second as ‘Event B’.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the previous section we talked about conditional probability. The probability of some event <m>A</m> given some event <m>B</m>.
      If events are independent, since one does not affect the other, we can define the conditional probability <me>P(A|B)=P(A)</me>
      Furthermore, <me>P(B|A)=P(B)</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this is not a definition for independence. The probability of “<m>A</m> given <m>B</m>” is not the converse of “<m>B</m> given <m>A</m>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Refer back to the previous example on Section 2.4. The probability of getting snake eyes, given we already rolled a one, is equal to the probability of just rolling a one.
    </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>A</m> is the event you roll an even number and <m>B</m> is the event you roll a four. Are these events independent?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <m>P(A \cap B) \neq P(A)P(B)</m>. Not independent!
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <statement>
  <p>
    How do you think the formal definition of independence would extend to three independent events A, B, and C?
  </p>
  <solution>
    <me>P(A\cap B\cap C)=P(A)P(B)P(C)</me>
  </solution>
</statement>
  <p>
    It is also true that if three events are independent, for any combination of two events, independence still holds such that
  </p>
  <p>
    <me>P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)</me>
  </p>
  <p>
    <me>P(B\cap C)=P(B)P(C)</me>
  </p>
  <p>
    <me>P(A\cap C)=P(A)P(C)</me>
  </p>
