<p>We can apply our indicator function is_five to each roll in this list. Then, the sum of the list can be either 0,1,2,3, or 4. If the sum is zero, that must mean there are no fives, which is a failure, while if the sum is positive, it means that at least one roll was a five, which is a success. We can write a function, is_positive(), to help us distinguish success from failure in this case. Run the code below to see the result of an experiment of rolling four dice, and seeing if at least one of the dice is a five. This is step two of the simulation process. Run it several times to see that sometimes the experiment "succeeds" and sometimes the experiment "fails."</p>
