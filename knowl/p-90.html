<div class="para">So far, we have been able to calculate probabilities in two ways. The first is counting the size of an event, and dividing by the size of the sample space, under the assumption that each singleton event is equally likely. The second is to argue from the axioms of theorems of probability. Sometimes, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to calculate a probability using the the aforementioned techniques. Also, for students and experts alike, mistakes in calculating a probability can easily occur. Being able to arrive at an approximation of a probability by running experiments is an essential tool for analyzing probabilities.</div>
