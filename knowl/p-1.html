<p>There are a lot of ways to think about probability philosophically, but we will save that nuance until we have a good working relationship with probability. For now, we will approach probability through the idea of equally likely outcomes. In short, to calculate the probability of a specific thing occuring, we will calculate the number of ways that the specific thing can occur, and divide by the total number of possible things. With this idea in mind, counting becomes paramount. Therefore, before we can deal with probability, we have to deal with counting.</p>
