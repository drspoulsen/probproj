<p>Neither is correct or better, but instead, they are two different ways of thinking and approaching probability. However, it can be said that one is more applicable than the other. Bayesian is more applicable when you are computing the probability of events that cannot be repeated over and over, like a sports game or an election. However, if we want to find out the probability of rolling a dice or flipping a coin, it makes sense to use a Frequentist perspective because these are events that can realistically be repeated over and over again. Nevertheless, it is entirely up to the person to decide which perspective to use, which one you may think is better in the situation.</p>
