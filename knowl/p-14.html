<p>Imagine you are listening to your top 5 favorite song playlist on a shuffle mode where no song repeats before the end of the playlist. Since each song has a random chance of playing at the start, there are 5 choices to choose from. Once that song is finished we now have only 4 options to choose from. As each song ends, there becomes one less option to choose from. Each complete listen through of these songs is what is called a permutation of the playtlist. If you have taken a statistics class before, this may look similar to sampling without replacement. This is because as each song ends, we are not putting it back in the population to potentially be replayed (resampled) again.</p>
