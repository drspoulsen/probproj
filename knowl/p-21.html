<p>Why does it make sense to use factorials to determine the amount of permutations of a set? Let's think back to the multiplication principle and how that would be applied to the playlist example. When we begin the playlist we start with 5 options and once the song ends we go down to 4; to find all of the possibilities of songs for just these two we would do <span class="process-math">\(5 * 4\text{.}\)</span> After the second songs ends we then have 3 songs to choose from. We can then take the 20 potential possibilities from the first two songs and multiply them by 3 to get the total amount of combinations for 3 songs. We can continue this trend until we get down to the last remaining song. What we would find is that we end up computing <span class="process-math">\(5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1\)</span> which is equal to <span class="process-math">\(5! \text{.}\)</span></p>
