<div class="para">A simulation can be done without a computer. For example, if you want to know the probability seeing at least one five when you roll four six-sided dice simultaneously, you could roll four dice many times, and count the number of times you see a five on at least one dice. An estimate for the probability will be the number of times you see at least one five divided by the number of times you rolled the four dice. If the mathematical model of probability matches our collective intuition of what probability is, then we should expect that as the number of rolls of four dice gets larger and larger, the estimated probability should approach the "true" probability.</div>
